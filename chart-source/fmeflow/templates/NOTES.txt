Congratulations, your FME Flow should be ready shortly! You can check the progress of the deployment by typing:

  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods

Once all containers are running, you should be able to access your deployment under {{ template "fmeflow.deployment.protocol" . }}://{{ .Values.deployment.hostname }}

To ensure that everything is working correctly, helm provides a test framework which can be run once the FME Flow is up and running and licensed:

  $ helm test {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} --logs --timeout 10m0s

This runs a set of tests that test basic FME Flow functionality.

Things to check if something does not work:
  - Is the NGINX ingress controller deployed? Check the following link for more details: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/
  - Does your server have enough disk storage?
  - Are your nodes large enough / do you have enough nodes?
  - Check if there any negative events on any of the fmeflow resources by running the command:
    $ kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} --field-selector type!=Normal
