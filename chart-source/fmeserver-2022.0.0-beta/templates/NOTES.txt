Congratulations, your FME Server should be ready shortly! You can check the progress of the deployment by typing:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Helm V2:
  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}

Once all containers are running, you should be able to access your deployment under {{ template "fmeserver.deployment.protocol" . }}://{{ .Values.deployment.hostname }}

To ensure that everything is working correctly, helm provides a test framework which can be run once the FME Server is up and running (does currently NOT work for Docker on Mac/Windows):

  $ helm test {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Helm V2:
  $ helm test {{ .Release.Name }}

Things to check if something does not work:
  - Is the NGINX ingress controller deployed? Check the following link for more details: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/
  - Does your server have enough disk storage?

To uninstall/delete FME Server (this deletes all data):
  $ helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Helm V2:
  $ helm del --purge {{ .Release.Name }}
